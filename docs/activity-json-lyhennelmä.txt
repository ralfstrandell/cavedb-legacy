1.  Introduction

   JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) [RFC8259] is a popular format used
   in web applications.  GeoJSON [RFC7946] [GeoJSON] is a format for
   encoding a variety of geographic data structures using JSON.

Arkko                   Expires November 2, 2020                [Page 2]
Internet-Draft                Activity JSON                     May 2020


   Activity JSON can be directly supplied to a wide variety of software
   that accepts GeoJSON.

2.  Normative Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Goals

   There are many tools and formats to manipulate, collect, store, and
   display collections of points or other geographic objects.  Formats
   for information relating to this (such as [RFC7946] or [KML]) are
   prior art and not something that needs to be replicated.

   an extension of GeoJSON properties

Internet-Draft                Activity JSON                     May 2020


   It should also be noted that defining a data format is just about
   defining a data format, and it is not a solution for all other
   problems.  For instance, the following are outside the scope of the
   sharing data format and therefore non-goals for this effort:

   o  Representing media about particular activities.  This work takes
      the approach that all substantial information is merely a
      reference rather than the data itself.

   o  Access control to non-public information.The format is best suited
      for bulk transfer of public data (with the occasional obfuscated
      location).

4.  Modelling Activities

   First off, there's a philosophical question of whether we are
   describing real-world entities or their exploration.  We've chosen to
   model everything as visits or exploration, leaving some coordinates,



Arkko                   Expires November 2, 2020                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                Activity JSON                     May 2020


   descriptions, articles and maps as a record of the activity.

   Nevertheless, we've chosen to structure the model around the
   locations, in line with GeoJSON.  Each activity, report, participant
   list, cave map, etc. is hanging off the location, rather than being
   an independent entity that has locations.

   In great amounts, such additional information can become confusing,
   however.  We've chosen to enable the model to show relationships,
   such as a mountaintop having a relation to the ski resort.  Or a side
   peak having a relationship to the main peak of a mountain.  This
   additional information can then be chosen to be used or displayed by
   software or ignored, depending on the needs of the application, the
   granularity of the map being shown, etc.

   The distinction between a main attraction and side ones is perhaps
   more relevant for caving.  Where there are caves there are often
   several in a group, or small side caves accompany a larger cave.  And
   even for a large cave itself, there may be multiple entrances.

   In this version of the specification, the supported activities and
   their sub-activities are as follows:


Arkko                   Expires November 2, 2020                [Page 5]
Internet-Draft                Activity JSON                     May 2020


   Caving

      The sub-activities consist of a number sub-attributes that can be
      combined to represent a detailed activity and environment.

      The sub-activities can represent the following aspects.  Different
      aspects can appear in an orthogonal manner, e.g., you could be
      diving while visiting an ice cave.  Not all combinations make
      sense, of course, but in general one can combine a number of
      different sub-activities in one experience.

      Environment

         Rock, Ice, Man-made, and Other-material.

         Rock-Granite, Rock-Limestone, Rock-Sandstone,
         Rock-Marble, Rock-Volcanic, and Rock-Other.

         Morphology-Crack, Morphology-Boulders, Morphology-Karst,
         Morphology-Volcanic, Morphology-Erosion, and Morphology-Other.

      Caving method

         None, Basic, SRT, Swimming, Boating, Diving, Digging, and Skiing.
         More than one of these may appear in a single trip.

      Associated activities

         Surveying, Researching, Training, Studying, Social,
         Equipment, Media, and Other.

      Independent characteristics

         You may be visiting a show cave tour, if so, you can use the
         sub-activity tag "Showtour".

   Climbing

      The sub-activities are Mountain, Rock, Ice, Wall, and Volcanoes.

   Diving

      There are no sub-activities.

5.  Generation 2 Format

   The format is a specialization of GeoJSON.  Every Activity JSON
   object is also a valid GeoJSON object, but has some extra properties
   to carry the information that is needed to describe the activities.

   For example, an empty file contains just:

             {
               "type": "FeatureCollection",
               "features": []
             }

   Here's an example of a file with just one entry:

     {
       "type": "FeatureCollection",
       "features": [
           {
             "type":
                "Feature",
             "geometry":
                { "type": "Point",
                  "coordinates": [60.30145486, 24.62792567] },
             "properties": {
               "n": "Kattilajaerven iso lippaluola, Nuuksio, Espoo",
               "m": "https://example.com/cavemap-kattilajarvi.pdf",
               "l": 9.3,
               "la": "exact",
               "k": "Espoo",
               "c": "Finland",
               "o": "Europe",
               "rl": [{ "t": "Kattilajaervi roof caves",
                        "i": "https://example.com/a-picture.jpg",
                        "w": ["Jari"],
                        "y": 2020,

                        "u": "https://example.com/an-article.html" }
                     ]
              }

Internet-Draft                Activity JSON                     May 2020


5.1.  Features

   In this version of the specification, only features of the type
   "Point" are allowed.

5.2.  Properties

   The properties described in a GeoJSON file are as follows:

   n

      The name of the place.  By convention the last item of the name
      (after last comma) should be city name.  Mandatory.

   an

      This optional field allows listing alternative names, should the
      place have several names or several alternative spellings of the
      same name.  The value, if present, should be an array of strings
      in the same format as in the "n" field.

   lat, lon

      The coordinates, in WGS84 format.  Mandatory.

   ac

      In some cases there are alternative coordinates for some reason,
      perhaps different measurements or different entrances or different
      location within a larger entity.  The "ac" field can be used to
      carry these coordinates.  Its value should be an array of records,
      with each record having the "lat" and "lon" fields.  The "ac"
      field is optional.

   d

      Free-form text description of the location.  Optional.  Note that
      this SHOULD NOT be used to write long stories about the location,
      but rather a line or two about it.  The articles and URLs
      referenced from the entry are the right place to write full
      descriptions.  But the short description may be displayed by tools
      when hovering over the location by mouse, etc.

      The text itself can be in two forms, either simply the text as is.
      In that case there is only one text available, and it is in
      whatever language it happens to be.  An example:

             "d": "This place is really cool!"



Arkko                   Expires November 2, 2020               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                Activity JSON                     May 2020


      Alternatively, the text may be a record with two-letter language
      codes representing language versions.  See Section 5.4 for the
      available language code designations.

      Here is an example:

             "d": {
                      "en": "This place is really cool!",
                      "fi": "Ei paskempi paikka!"
                    }

   ad

      Optional alternative descriptions, if any.  The value should be an
      array of description objects, where each object should have the
      field "d" for the description (as above) and "s" for the source of
      the alternate description.

   rn

      This optional attribute enables building relations between
      different items.  The "rn" attribute identifies another entity in
      the same dataset that there is a special relationship to.  The
      value of the "rn" attribute should be a list, with one list
      element for each different relationship that the item is involved
      in.  By default, items do not have relationships, and in this case
      the list can be empty or omitted entirely.

      Each entry in the list should be a string, the name of the place
      where there's a relationship to, i.e., the value of the "n"
      attribute in some other item in the same dataset.  The "rt"
      attribute provides the type of this relationship.

   rt

      This optional attribute MUST be present when the "rn" attribute is
      present.  The "rt" attribute describes the type of the
      relationship.  Since there can be a number of relationships, the
      value should be a list.  Each list item should be a string that
      describes a relationship type.  Currently supported relationship
      types are:

      *  "entranceof": This entity is another entrance to the same cave
         as described in the entity referred to.

      *  "entrance": A reverse relationship of the above, i.e., this
         entity points to another entity that represents another
         entrance to this cave.

Internet-Draft                Activity JSON                     May 2020


      *  "sidecaveof": This entity is another (side) cave of the main
         cave described in the entity referred to.

      *  "sidecave": A reverse relationship of the above, i.e., this
         entity points to another entity is a side cave of this cave.

      *  "secondaryto": This entity is an alternate/secondary entity
         that describes something already described by some other
         entity.  This can be used to represent reports from multiple,
         alternate sources about the same thing, for instance, when for
         some reason there is no desire to merge their entity
         descriptions in other ways.

      *  "secondary": A reverse relationship of the above, i.e., this
         entity points to another entity that is a secondary entry for
         this entity.

      *  "partof": This entity is somehow otherwise part of the entity
         referred to.

      *  "part": A reverse relationship of the above, i.e., this entity
         points to another entity that is a part of this entity.

   alt

      An optional attribute that describes the altitude the location or
      the highest point in the destination, in meters.

   aa

      An optional attribute that describes alternative altitudes (if
      there are several measurements or different locations within the
      place).

   fz

      Set to true if the coordinates are "fuzzy" to hide the true
      location for privacy etc. reasons.  Default is false.  This
      attribute is optional.

   m

      The cave map link URL, if any.  If there's no URL, the attribute
      SHOULD NOT be specified at all (and SHOULD NOT be set to, e.g.,
      empty string, although it is RECOMMENDED that software recognises
      empty strings similarly to missing attributes.

   am

      If there are several maps, additional links MAY be provided in
      this optional attribute.  Its value should be an array of URL
      strings.

   l

      The length of the cave in meters, if known.  The attribute is
      optional, and should be left out if no value is known.  The value
      should be a number and can include a decimal point.

   lc

      If the length is not specified, one can also specify a length
      category.  This is expressed as a string of the forms "<a", ">a",
      or "a><b" where a and b are numbers that may include also decimal
      points.  The numbers represents cave lengths in meters, and
      express the cave length size category, e.g., cave larger than 50
      meters long would be represented as ">50".

   h

      The height/vertical difference in the cave in meters, if known.
      The attribute is optional, and should be left out if no value is
      known.

   la

      The cave length and height accuracy ("exact" or "approx").  The
      attribute is optional, and the default value is "approx" if no
      other value is provided.

   k

      The city/town/county.  In Finland the relevant "kunta" or
      community should be filled in.  This attribute is mandatory.

   c

      The country.  This attribute is mandatory.

   o

      The continent.  This attribute is mandatory.

   rl

      The "reading list", a list of articles describing visits etc.
      This can of course be empty, i.e., [], but the attribute itself is
      mandatory.  The description of what an article object is can be
      found from Section 5.3.

   s

      The source of the data, if specified.  The source is simply
      represented as a string.  Note that the source often defaults from
      whereever the data is being fetched, so typically this does not
      need to be set unless somehow specifically different from other
      entries.

5.3.  Article Objects

   Aach article is a JSON record.  The record has the following fields:

   t

      The title.  This attribute is mandatory.

   i

      URL for an image representing the article.  This attribute is
      optional.  If no image URL known, the attribute should not be
      specified at all.

   w

      List of people who were there.  This attribute is mandatory.

   y

      Year of visit (as a number).  This attribute is mandatory.

   m

      The activity: Caving, Skiing, etc.  This attribute is mandatory.

   sa

      The sub-activity, e.g., within caving sub-activities or cave types
      are can be Rock, Ice, and so on, wereas within skiing they the
      sub-activities can be Outdoor, Indoor, Snow, Sand, and so on.
      This attribute is mandatory.

   p

      Each article may be described by a URL (if available) or by a
      printed publication such as a book.  The "p" field provides the
      name of the book and any associated other reference information
      such as page or section numbers.  If there's a URL for the book
      itself (not the article in the book), use the field "pu" for that.

   u

      URL for the article.  This attribute is optional.  If no URL is
      known, the attribute should not be specified at all.

   pu

      URL for a publication that contains the article.  E.g., if there's
      an article about the topic or place in a book, place the book
      article here.

   s

      The source of the data, if specified and different from the source
      of the overall entry.
